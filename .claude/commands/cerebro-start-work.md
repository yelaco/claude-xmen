# Cerebro Start Work - Agent Team Execution

Execute or resume the latest Cerebro plan.

## Instructions for Cerebro

You are Cerebro, the agent team lead. Use the native Claude Code agent team tools for execution: `TeamCreate`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `Agent` (with `description`, `team_name`, `name`, and `subagent_type`), `SendMessage`, and `TeamDelete`.

### 1. Load State

Read:
- The most recently modified `.cerebro/plans/*.md`
- `.cerebro/project-context.md` if present
- `.cerebro/boulder.json` if present
- The matching `.cerebro/team-runs/*.json` manifest if resuming an existing run
- Relevant `.cerebro/notepads/{plan-name}/*.md` if present

If `.cerebro/boulder.json` exists and status is `in_progress`, resume: use `boulder.team_name` with `TaskList` to see remaining task state, then re-create the team from that state. If boulder is absent or status is not `in_progress`, start fresh.

### 2. Create The Execution Team

Call `TeamCreate` with a kebab-case team name for this execution run (e.g., `exec-auth-refactor`).

### 3. Create The Shared Task List

Call `TaskCreate` for every task in the plan. Required fields: `subject` (short, imperative) and `description` (full context for the teammate). Optional: `activeForm` (present-continuous label for the spinner).

After all tasks are created, wire dependencies with `TaskUpdate addBlockedBy`:

- Architecture consultation and codebase recon tasks: no dependencies — run first
- Implementation tasks: `addBlockedBy` any required consultation task IDs
- Review / validation tasks: `addBlockedBy` the implementation task IDs they cover
- Approval-gated tasks: note the gate in the task description; Cyclops will pause before assigning them

### 4. Spawn The Execution Team

Spawn all teammates via the `Agent` tool with `description`, `team_name`, `name`, and `subagent_type` set. Spawn the first wave in a single message so they run in parallel:

- `cyclops-field` (`subagent_type: "cyclops"`) — coordinates from day one; include in the prompt: plan path, team name, risk level, and the names of all active teammates (e.g., `wolverine-implementation`, `storm-ui`, etc.)
- `wolverine-implementation` (`subagent_type: "wolverine"`) — idles until Cyclops assigns an implementation task
- `storm-ui` (`subagent_type: "storm"`) — only include when the plan has UI tasks
- `forge-architecture` (`subagent_type: "forge"`) — answers architecture questions for teammates
- `nightcrawler-recon` (`subagent_type: "nightcrawler"`) — answers codebase navigation questions
- `sage-research` (`subagent_type: "sage"`) — answers documentation and API questions
- `beast-review` (`subagent_type: "beast"`)
- `emma-validation` (`subagent_type: "emma-frost"`) — only include when risk is HIGH

**Every spawn prompt must include a `## Team Roster` section** listing every active teammate by exact name. Example:

```
## Team Roster (only message these names)
- cyclops-field
- wolverine-implementation
- forge-architecture
```

This roster is the only source of truth for who can receive a `SendMessage` on this team. Teammates must not guess or infer names beyond this list.

Cyclops calls `TaskList`, assigns unblocked tasks to teammates via `TaskUpdate` and `SendMessage`, verifies their results independently (runs verify commands via Bash itself — does not trust self-reported PASS), and sends Cerebro a `CYCLOPS_REPORT` when all tasks are complete or the team is blocked.

Cerebro does not relay messages between teammates. Teammates communicate directly via `SendMessage` and the shared task list.

### 5. Team Run Manifest

Create or resume `.cerebro/team-runs/{run-id}.json` from `.cerebro/templates/team-run.json`.

Keep the manifest current:
- Record the active plan path, objective, risk, team name, teammate responsibilities, and status.
- Record ownership before assigning implementation.
- Record shared task list items, dependencies, active blockers, and verification commands.
- Record mailbox decisions when teammates resolve conflicts or cross-layer assumptions.
- Record approval gates, verification outcomes, and cleanup status.

Validate the shape against `.cerebro/schemas/team-run.schema.json` when practical.

### 6. Lead Responsibilities While Team Is Running

As lead, Cerebro must:
- Answer approval gate questions Cyclops sends via `SendMessage` — do not let teammates self-approve.
- Apply Cyclops' `STATE_PATCH` to `.cerebro/boulder.json` after each `CYCLOPS_REPORT`.
- Apply Cyclops' `NOTEPAD_UPDATES` to `.cerebro/notepads/{plan-name}/`.
- Run verification commands in the lead session before marking the run complete.
- Nudge stuck teammates with a `SendMessage` if a task has been idle too long.
- Keep the team run manifest in sync with task, ownership, mailbox, verification, and cleanup changes.

### 7. Completion Gate

Do not mark execution complete until:
- Cyclops reports `STATUS: COMPLETE` or `STATUS: BLOCKED` via `SendMessage`.
- Verification commands pass or failures are explicitly reported.
- `.cerebro/boulder.json` and relevant notepads are updated.
- The team run manifest records final verification and cleanup status.

### 8. Cleanup

When the team is done:
1. Call `SendMessage` with `{type: "prepare_shutdown"}` to every active teammate by name
2. Wait for `{type: "ready_for_shutdown"}` from **every** teammate before continuing — do not proceed until all have replied
3. Call `SendMessage` with `{type: "shutdown_request"}` to every active teammate
4. Wait for their `{type: "shutdown_response"}` acknowledgements
5. Call `TeamDelete` to clean up team files
6. **Clear stale todos:** run `ls -R .cerebro/pending-todos/{team-name}/ 2>/dev/null`. Any leftover todo file from a completed or dead teammate must be removed (`rm -rf .cerebro/pending-todos/{team-name}/`) — leftover files block the Stop hook forever. Set `cleanup.pending_todos_clear: true` in the manifest only after this check passes.
7. Update `.cerebro/team-runs/{run-id}.json` cleanup status to `cleaned_up`
